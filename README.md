5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?

6. How we implemented the tic-tac-toe hand gesture game.
- We mapped each hand gesture to a place on the tic-tac-toe board. We chose to have the camera in the center, so you can see both the camera and the boards at once. We decided to have another tic-tac-toe board, but with the hand gestures so people know what gestures correspond to the position on the board. The website is also responsive, so it can be viewed when the window adjusts. This is done by media queries, and changing flex-direction. We decided to also implement local storage by using javascript window's API, so users can see how many times X's won and O's won.
